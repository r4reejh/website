			<p>I am a Senior Software Engineer at PingSafe, a leading cybersecurity company that offers comprehensive solutions for cloud and web applications. I have a BTech in Information Technology from Vellore Institute of Technology, where I graduated in 2019. My core competencies include Python, Java, Node, Go, and various databases and frameworks.

                At PingSafe, I contribute across multiple sub-products, including the main platform and microservices. I am the author and technical owner of the PingSafe Offensive Security Engine, a powerful tool that performs automated penetration testing and vulnerability scanning. I also set up OLAP Analytics for PingSafe, using ClickHouse, a high-performance column-oriented database. Previously, I worked as a backend software engineer at Shell, where I automated processes, reduced manual efforts, and won a people's choice award. I also did an internship at Vicara, where I worked on their flagship product, the Kai, a gesture-based controller. I am passionate about creating innovative and secure software solutions that solve real-world problems. I value collaboration, learning, and feedback, and I strive to bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team.</p>
